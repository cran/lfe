Description: Transforms away factors with many levels prior to doing an OLS.
    Useful for estimating linear models with multiple group fixed effects, and for
    estimating linear models which uses factors with many levels as pure control
    variables. Includes support for instrumental variables, conditional F statistics
    for weak instruments, robust and multi-way clustered standard errors, as well as
    limited mobility bias correction.
