#' Centre vectors on multiple groups
#'
#' @description
#'  Uses the method of alternating projections to centre
#'  a (model) matrix on multiple groups, as specified by a list of factors.
#'  This function is called by \code{\link{felm}}, but it has been
#'  made available as standalone in case it's needed.
#' @export
#\usage{
#demeanlist(mtx, fl, icpt=0, eps=getOption('lfe.eps'),
#           threads=getOption('lfe.threads'),
#           progress=getOption('lfe.pint'),
#           accel=getOption('lfe.accel'),
#           randfact=TRUE,
#           means=FALSE,
#           weights=NULL,
#           scale=TRUE,
#           .inplace=FALSE)
#}

#' @param mtx matrix whose columns form vectors to be group-centred. mtx
#'  can also be a list of vectors or matrices, such as a data frame.
#' @param fl list of factors defining the grouping structure.
#' @param icpt the position of the intercept, this column is removed from
#' the result matrix.
#' @param eps a tolerance for the centering.
#' @param threads an integer specifying the number of threads to use.
#' @param progress integer. If positive, make progress reports (whenever a
#' vector is centered, but not more often than every \code{progress} minutes).
#' @param accel integer. Set to 1 if Gearhart-Koshy acceleration should be done.
#' @param randfact logical. Should the order of the factors be randomized?
#' This may improve convergence.
#' @param means logical. Should the means instead of the demeaned matrix be
#'  returned? Setting \code{means=TRUE} will return \code{mtx -  demeanlist(mtx,...)},
#' but without the extra copy.
#' @param weights numeric. For weighted demeaning.
#' @param scale logical. Specify scaling for weighted demeaning.
#'
#' @details
#' For each column \code{y} in \code{mtx}, the equivalent of the
#' following centering is performed, with \code{cy} as the result.
#' \preformatted{  
#' cy <- y; oldy <- y-1
#' while(sqrt(sum((cy-oldy)**2)) >= eps) {
#'  oldy <- cy
#'  for(f in fl) cy <- cy - ave(cy,f)
#' }
#' }
#'
#' Each factor in \code{fl} may contain an
#' attribute \code{'x'} which is a numeric vector of the same length as
#' the factor. The centering is then not done on the means of each group,
#' but on the projection onto the covariate in each group.  That is, with a
#' covariate \code{x} and a factor \code{f}, it is like projecting out the
#' interaction \code{x:f}.  The \code{'x'} attribute can also be a matrix of column
#' vectors, in this case it can be beneficial to orthogonalize the columns,
#' either with a stabilized Gram-Schmidt method, or with the simple
#' method \code{x \%*\% solve(chol(crossprod(x)))}.
#'
#' The \code{weights} argument is used if a weighted projection is
#' computed.  If \eqn{W} is the diagonal matrix with \code{weights} on the
#' diagonal, \code{demeanlist} computes \eqn{W^{-1} M_{WD} W x} where \eqn{x} is
#' the input vector, \eqn{D} is the matrix of dummies from \code{fl} and
#' \eqn{M_{WD}} is the projection on the orthogonal complement of
#' the range of the matrix \eqn{WD}.  It is possible to implement the
#' weighted projection with the \code{'x'} attribute mentioned above, but
#' it is a separate argument for convenience.
#' If \code{scale=FALSE}, \code{demeanlist} computes \eqn{M_{WD} x} without
#' any \eqn{W} scaling.
#' If \code{length(scale) > 1}, then \code{scale[1]} specifies whether
#' the input should be scaled by \eqn{W}, and \code{scale[2]} specifies
#' whether the output should be scaled by \eqn{W^{-1}}.  This is just
#' a convenience to save some memory copies in other functions in the package.
#' 
#' Note that for certain large datasets the overhead in \code{\link{felm}}
#' is large compared to the time spent in \code{demeanlist}. If the data
#' are present directly without having to use the formula-interface to
#' \code{felm} for transformations etc, it is possible to run
#' \code{demeanlist} directly on a matrix or \code{"data.frame"} and do the
#' OLS "manually", e.g. with something like
#' \code{beta <- solve(crossprod(demeanlist(mtx,...))) \%*\% (t(x) \%*\% y)}
#' 
#' In some applications it is known that a single centering iteration is
#' sufficient. In particular, if \code{length(fl)==1} and there is no
#' interaction attribute \code{x}.  In this case the centering algorithm is
#' terminated after the first iteration. There may be other cases, e.g. if
#' there is a single factor with a matrix \code{x} with orthogonal columns. If
#' you have such prior knowledge, it is possible to force termination after
#' the first iteration by adding an attribute \code{attr(fl, 'oneiter') <-
#' TRUE}.  Convergence will be reached in the second iteration anyway, but
#' you save one iteration, i.e. you double the speed.
#' 
#' @return
#' If \code{mtx} is a matrix, a matrix of the same shape, possibly with 
#' column \code{icpt} deleted.
#' 
#' If \code{mtx} is a list of vectors and matrices, a list of the same
#' length is returned, with the same vector and matrix-pattern, but the
#' matrices have the column \code{icpt} deleted.  
#' 
#' If \code{mtx} is a \code{'data.frame'}, a \code{'data.frame'} 
#' with the same names is returned; the \code{icpt} argument is ignored.

#' @note
#' The \code{accel} argument enables Gearhart-Koshy acceleration as
#' described in Theorem 3.16 by Bauschke, Deutsch, Hundal and Park in "Accelerating the
#' convergence of the method of alternating projections",
#' Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 355 pp 3433-3461 (2003).
#'
#' \code{demeanlist} will use an in place transform to save memory, provided the \code{mtx}
#' argument is unnamed. Thus, as always in R, you shouldn't use temporary variables
#' like \code{tmp <- fun(x[v,]); bar <- demeanlist(tmp,...); rm(tmp)}, it will be much better to
#' do \code{bar <- demeanlist(fun(x[v,]),...)}
