1.1-434
	Changed the argument name 'model' of felm to 'formula', also call model.frame()
	in the parent context, so one may get away without a data.frame.

	Updated and expanded documentation.

	Added a summary.felm function, and a corresponding print.

	Added syntax of the type y ~ x + G(id) for the grouping factors.
	The fl argument to felm still works.	

1.1-427
	Changed the print and summary functions. Class "fe.lm" is now "felm".
	In particular the coefficients-entry from felm is now a vector, not a matrix.
