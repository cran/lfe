1.3-512 
	Bootstrap standard errors with Kaczmarz, user defined estimable function
	which defaults to something similar to what lm does.
	Give progress report every 5 minutes.
	Allow group interactions of the type G(id*firm).
	Demean y together with x, improves parallelism.
	Handle multi-collinearities in the ordinary covariates.

1.2-452
	Remove duplicate rows in the Kaczmarz method.  Different
	convergence check, both in demeaning and Kaczmarz, using
	convergence rate summed up to infinity.
	
1.2-444
	Implemented the Kaczmarz method for solving the factor-system, made it default.	

1.1-434
	Changed the argument name 'model' of felm to 'formula', also call model.frame()
	in the parent context, so one may get away without a data.frame.

	Updated and expanded documentation.

	Added a summary.felm function, and a corresponding print.

	Added syntax of the type y ~ x + G(id) for the grouping factors.
	The fl argument to felm still works.	

1.1-427
	Changed the print and summary functions. Class "fe.lm" is now "felm".
	In particular the coefficients-entry from felm is now a vector, not a matrix.

1.0-418
	Initial version on cran
